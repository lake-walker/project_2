                    <p>The purpose behind this project was to look at different global indexes and see if there is a correlation between these different indexes and suicide rates globally. This could show how developing nations can prioritize certain aspects of their economy and/or society in order to lower suicide rates amongst its population.</p>

                    <p><strong>Suicide Rates:</strong> For this analysis we wil be looking at the number of suicedes per 100,000 people in the population.</p>

                    <p><strong>Human Development Index (HDI):</strong> HDI attempts to create an index that looks beyond GDP for determining a countries capabilities. The Human Development Index is a summary of key dimesnions in human development. Those dimesnions include: life expectancy, education (number of years of education), and standard of living (GNI per Capita). HDI is measure between 0 and 1 with 1 being the highest and most developed and 0 being the least developed nations.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Happiness Index: </strong> The report is primarily based on individual respondant ratings. This provides some difficulty in gathering data and reports as this index is done entirely by survey. Rated out of 10 with 10 being the happiest life and 0 being the saddest.</p>

                    <p><strong>GDP per Capita: </strong>GDP or Gross Domestic Product is a measure of a country's economic output. It measures the added value from the production of goods and services in a given country over a certain period of time, typically a year. Per capita means it accounts for each individual in a population. </p>
