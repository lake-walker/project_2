Suicide Rates vs. Happiness and other indexes

Overview: 

•	800,000 people die from suicide every year. That accounts for about 1.4% of total global deaths

•	The trend is moving downward in much of the developed world

•	In some countries suicide is taboo and/or even illegal which seems a bit ridiculous. Those nations that have punishments for attempted suicides tend to be in Asia and Africa. While some do still exist in other parts of the world

•	Because of these negative views on suicide and attempted suicide the rates tend to be underreported as cause of death is covered up or never reported

•	Do nations experience a decrease in suicide rates due to development?

•	The purpose behind this project was to look at different global indexes and see if there is a correlation between these different indexes and suicide rates globally. This could show how developing nations can prioritize certain aspects of their economy and/or society in order to lower suicide rates amongst its population

Variables:

•	Suicides: For this analysis we will be looking at the number of suicides per 100,000 people in the population.

•	HDI: HDI attempts to create an index that looks beyond GDP for determining a countries capabilities. The Human Development Index is a summary of key dimensions in human development. Those dimensions include: life expectancy, education (number of years of education), and standard of living (GNI per Capita). HDI is measure between 0 and 1 with 1 being the highest and most developed and 0 being the least developed nations.

•	Happiness Index: The report is primarily based on individual respondent ratings. This provides some difficulty in gathering data and reports as this index is done entirely by survey. Rated out of 10 with 10 being the happiest life and 0 being the saddest.

•	GDP per capita: GDP or Gross Domestic Product is a measure of a country's economic output. It measures the added value from the production of goods and services in a given country over a certain period of time, typically a year. Per capita means it accounts for each individual in a population.

•	I chose these independent variables because GDP is the typical index used for determining a nations worth or capabilities. During economic and policy discussions GDP per capita is used heavily to influence political and economic decisions.

•	The Happiness index and HDI both take a different look at the capabilities of the individuals that make up a country/economy. They are more accurate representations of what day to day life is like in each country. 

•	If there is a correlation between any of these variables and suicides per 100k than that could be used to help guide policy to limit the number of suicides in developed and developing nations.

Visualizations:

•	Bubble chart
  o	Grouping of regions
  o	The outliers and unexpected results
  o	No firm relationship appears for any of the variables

•	Bar Chart
  o	Continues to confirm the regional differences and generalizations we can make about those regions

•	Map
  o	Visualization of how the different indexes layout accross the globe. More regional similarities are shown. 

Conclusion

•	In conclusion I cannot accept the original hypothesis for this project. There is not correlation between these variables and suicide rates. More in depth and niche data and research would provide a better understanding of how nations can work towards lowering their death by suicide.

•	In my findings from this project I came to the conclusion that the global Happiness Index is not a valid indicator of what a certain countries suicide rates will be. Looking at GDP per Capita, which is considered the go to measurement for a countries development and individual liberties, also does not show any relationship with suicide data. The Human Development Index offered the most promising correlation to suicides per 100k, however it failed to generate a significant relationship between the two variables.

•	Developed nations are no better at lowering their suicide rates as developing nations are. Economic and development status are not indicators of lower suicide rates globally. A nation cannot expect to see a decrease in their suicide rate by simply following the established development cycle like other before it. Those same nations that have lead the world in economic prosperity are no better off than those that are lagging behind.

•	If I were to repeat this study again I would drill down into the more detailed data and find specific indicators that drive down the suicide rates. Things like access to healthcare, levels of education, religion, debt to income ratio, and political stability. I think these variables take a deeper dive into how a country treats each individual citizen and the desire to better everyones life within their population. It would also be noteworthy to look at the situations surrounding suicides if that data is accessable. The percentage that happen within a prison system, and how many people commited suicide with undiagnosed and medicated mental health issues. It might be far fetched to think that this kind of data is easily accessible, but I think it's valuable to look at how countries treat their citizens.
